# psychic_game
The game "Psychic" coded in Javascript
.

Notes: This game works through a single iteration, but it does not reset after a win or a loss.
I reached a point of "diminishing returns" where my attempts to fix one issue would cause another. 
I think the class could have used another week of learning Javascript, how it flows, how it handles 
functions and the scope of local/global variables. None of this architecture was really discussed.
An assignment that just involved creating a few functions that perform specific tasks, gather specific
data, and returning that data to other functions would have been a good intermediary step.
